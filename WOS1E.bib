Abstract = {{Bargaining regularly takes place on the business-to-business side of
   two-sided markets. However, little is known about the consequences of
   these negotiations. In this paper, we allow the platform (or a policy
   maker) to choose between a standard design (offering posted prices to
   both sides) or a design with bargaining (offering a posted price to
   consumers and negotiating with at least some firms). We find that the
   platform pursues negotiations when it has a strong bargaining position
   and does so by targeting firms with the largest network effects. While
   this behavior may appear exploitive, we show that profits and welfare
   often align across platform designs. This alignment stems from how
   bargaining incentivizes the platform: Greater platform bargaining power
   allows the platform to extract more of the network surpluses, since it
   can convert more of the firm surplus into profits, and this incentivizes
   the platform to draw in greater participation (generating greater
   welfare). These results suggest that platform and policy maker
   preferences often align in this setting. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In recent years, the power of large technology corporations has become a
   focus of public debate in both developed and developing countries. This
   growing chorus brings together complaints about breaches of privacy and
   data protection, competition and market consolidation, and electoral and
   other political interference. The most powerful of these companies have
   grown into behemoths by establishing themselves both as purveyors of
   their own products, and as the hosts of ``platforms{''} that
   circumscribe, and profit from, the activities of other organizations.
   This platform function gives these companies substantial power over
   their commercial rivals, who depend upon these platforms to operate.
   More fundamentally, this article argues, the dual function of these
   ``platform companies{''} allows them to straddle the very categories
   that we use to organize our understanding of the political and economic
   world. They are at once product companies, service companies and
   infrastructure companies; players in the market and markets of the
   marketplace; private platforms and public spheres. The straddling of
   these categories places these companies in the institutional cracks of
   the regulatory system. Moreover, companies consciously exploit this
   regulatory straddling to thwart challenges to their power. This article
   argues that such deliberate shape-shifting has allowed these companies
   to control the political and economic stage on which their own power
   must be contested, and compromised the ability of scholars, the public
   and ultimately states to see clearly, and therefore constrain, that
   power.}},

Abstract = {{Digital markets offer abundant free content but exhibit extreme
   concentration among content aggregation intermediaries. These
   characteristics are linked. Weak copyright environments select against
   stand-alone content-delivery structures and select for bundled
   aggregation structures in which free content for users promotes
   positively priced advertising and data-collection services for firms.
   Dominant intermediaries promote commoditization, and the reallocation of
   market rents from content producers to content aggregators, through
   litigation and free content distribution that weaken copyright
   protections. The potential net welfare effects raise concern. Network
   effects, compounded by weak inventory constraints, scale economies, and
   learning effects, promote winner-takes-all outcomes in the intermediary
   services market while weak copyright may generate output distortions in
   the content production market.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the European Union finds itself in troubled waters. It has to
   prove that its benefits outweigh the costs of its endeavour. In this
   respect, an EU competition policy that focuses on consumer welfare is
   one way to gain support by the citizens of its member states. The
   Roaming Regulation that has reduced the mobile communications costs
   while travelling abroad serves as a good example for this approach. The
   EU Commission views consumer policy as another important factor to
   protect and benefit customers. In markets with natural monopolies, the
   two policies require the support of an effective regulatory policy. The
   research demonstrates that these three policies - if harmonised - are
   able to lead to an increase in consumer welfare (primarily by reducing
   prices) and that they protect the rights and interests of consumers. In
   the case of telecommunications, several initiatives of the European
   Commission and of national regulatory authorities to falls in prices and
   forced operators to implement customer friendly rules and to protect
   customer data and privacy.
   The authors consider that the European Commission has tried to establish
   and harmonise rules across all member states in order to protect the
   interests and rights of consumers on the telecommunication market. The
   enforcement of competition and consumer policy within institutions from
   the telecom field certainly could promote the focus on consumers and the
   possibility to use a large ``toolbox{''}. Harmonising and adjusting the
   policies across different countries and institutions and minimising any
   possible side effects is nevertheless a challenging task for the EU
   Commission in the future.}},

Abstract = {{The arrival of Trump in the White House does not augur well for the
   long-run prospects of the US economy. The protectionism that is
   gathering steam under his presidency may yield some short-term gains,
   but at the detriment of the long-run. Examining the discontent among
   ordinary voters that brought Trump to power, this paper argues that this
   should be treated as an opportunity for a major regulatory reform. With
   the advance of digital technology, we have increasing returns to scale,
   and that, in turn, is making our antitrust laws backfire and hurt the
   well-being of ordinary people, thereby sowing discontent. The paper
   builds a simple model to illustrate this and makes the case for revoking
   the older antitrust laws and replacing them with some simple
   profit-sharing rules at the level of the firm, and the economy. (C) 2018

Journal = {{REVIEW OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{5-16}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In policy circles of Washington DC, in academia, and among advocates and
   lobbyists, there has been growing attention to the role of antitrust
   enforcement versus regulation in today's economy (see, e.g., Shapiro in
   Int J Ind Organ 61:714-748, 2017). Various populist arguments seek an
   expanded role for antitrust law, as proponents seek to control the
   perceived political and free speech dangers associated with market
   concentration. These new populists are particularly interested in large,
   content-laden companies such as Google, Facebook, and broadcast and
   cable firms. Strong interest in content companies is, of course, not
   new. This essay explores different political, economic, and
   philosophical regimes at play when the United States chose to enact the
   Radio Act of 1927 and regulate, rather than leave to antitrust controls,
   the emerging radio industry. By examining antitrust at the dawn of the
   Radio Act of 1927, there are lessons to be learned for the political
   treatment of today's social media, broadcast, cable, and
   telecommunications industry. In particular the story of the Radio Act of
   1927 highlights two historically recurring political themes: (1) a
   longstanding, near-universal political goal to control content and (2)
   the tension between selecting an ex post antitrust enforcement regime
   versus an ex ante regulatory regime to control economic concentration
   and power. It is this second theme that is primarily explored here.}},

Abstract = {{Antitrust agencies in the United States and the European Union began
   investigating Googles search practices in 2010. Googles critics have
   consisted mainly of its competitors, particularly Microsoft, Yelp,
   TripAdvisor, and other search engines. They have alleged that Google is
   making it more difficult for them to compete by including specialized
   search results in general search pages and limiting access to search
   inputs, including scale, Google content, and the Android platform. Those
   claims contradict real-world experiences in search. They demonstrate
   competitors efforts to compete not by investing in efficiency, quality,
   or innovation, but by using antitrust law to punish the successful
   competitor. The Chicago School of law and economics teachesand the
   Supreme Court has long affirmedthat antitrust law exists to protect
   consumers, not competitors. Penalizing Googles practices as
   anticompetitive would violate that principle, reduce dynamic competition
   in search, and harm the consumers that the antitrust laws are intended
   to protect.}},

Abstract = {{This article conducts a detailed analysis of the concept of economic
   dependence and exploitative abuse based on how their treatment in
   competition law and economics and their enforcement in European case law
   have evolved. Although the theoretical roots of these concepts lie in
   economic theory, these issues have been ignored or considered only
   scantily in the context of competition law enforcement. An effects-based
   approach should take these problems into account and could provide
   insights into how to portray the impacts of these abuses. We draw on two
   examples - from the agri-food industries and the digital economy - of
   relevant economic dependence issues. This paper highlights the existence
   of a paradox: although industrial organization models provide relevant
   tools to characterize these abuses, assess their effects, and devise
   remedies, it seems that they are seldom used by competition law
   enforcers.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze exclusionary conduct of platforms in 2-sided markets.
   Motivated by recent antitrust cases, we provide a discussion of the
   likely positive and normative effects of exclusivity clauses, which
   prevent tenants from opening outlets in other shopping centers covered
   by the clause. In a standard 2-sided market model, we show that
   exclusivity agreements are especially profitable for the incumbent and
   detrimental to social welfare if competition is intense between the 2
   shopping centers. We argue that the focus of courts on market definition
   is misplaced in markets determined by competitive bottlenecks.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses whether, when manufacturers choose to adopt a
   selective distribution system, vertical restraints imposed on electronic
   commerce (e-commerce) may work in the interest of consumers or have
   anticompetitive consequences that require an antitrust intervention. The
   paper presents the basic economic concepts that apply to vertical
   restraints, and identifies the efficiency reasons and the
   anticompetitive effects that may motivate their adoption. Then, the
   relevant economic literature is surveyed in order to understand how
   e-commerce influences retail competition, taking into account its impact
   on search costs, distribution costs, and information asymmetry. The
   paper examines the legal treatment of vertical restraints on e-commerce
   in the case of selective distribution; it summarizes the position
   expressed by the European Commission in the Block Exemption Regulation
   and the accompanying guidelines, and then discusses some cases decided
   by National Competition Authorities, National Courts, and the European
   Courts. From this overview emerges the risk that the antitrust analysis
   of vertical restraints on e-commerce in selective distribution systems
   may be guided by presumptions that do not have solid economic grounds.
   The paper argues that it is unwise to adopt a formal approach for the
   legal assessment of these vertical restraints and calls for a more
   economic effect-based approach.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the incentives of a monopolistic search engine, funded by
   advertising, to provide reliable search results. We distinguish two
   types of search results: sponsored and organic (not-paid-for). Organic
   results are most important in searches for online content, while
   sponsored results are more important in product searches. By modeling
   the underlying markets for online content and offline products, we can
   identify the sources of distortions for each type of result, and their
   interaction. This explicit treatment proves crucial for understanding,
   not only spillovers across markets, but also fundamental policy issues,
   such as the welfare effects of integration. In particular, integration
   of the engine with a small fraction of content providers is
   welfare-enhancing when incentives to distort are stronger for sponsored
   than organic search, but welfare-reducing in the opposite case. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the determinants of disparities in coverage by
   cell telephone systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. It uses a spatially
   disaggregated probit for over 990,000 grid cells with adjustments for
   spatial autocorrelation. Determinants include potential market size
   (population); cost factors related to accessibility (elevation, slope,
   distance from a main road, and distance from the nearest large city);
   and competition policy. Estimates indicate significant results for the
   supply-demand variables, and very strong results for the competition
   policy index.
   Simulations suggest that a generalized improvement in competition policy
   could lead to huge improvements in cell phone area coverage, and to an
   overall coverage increase of nearly 100\%. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This paper aims to shed light on the economic tools, as well as the
   legal-economic reasoning, which are used by different European antitrust
   authorities to assess the allegedly anticompetitive practices of a
   platform operating in a two-sided market (2SM). First of all, we show
   that despite the flourishing literature on 2SM economics, antitrust
   authorities are still facing major challenges when taking decisions
   concerning two-sided platforms (2SPs). Secondly, we perform a
   cross-country, comparative study of recent competition proceedings
   towards the 2SP Booking.com and highlight conceptual and practical
   divergences among antitrust authorities which are bound by and applying
   a common European legislation. By concretely and thoroughly showing
   where the differences lie, our study contributes to identifying the
   issues to tackle to ensure a better harmonized implementation of
   measures towards 2SPs at the EU level. Finally, building on the results
   of our work, we propose some alternative approaches which could benefit
   future antitrust analyses in 2SMs.}},

Abstract = {{A vertical most-favored-nation (vMFN) restraint prohibits a retailer
   from charging more for one supplier's product than for rivals' products.
   For credit card services, this restraint takes the form of a
   no-surcharge rule: the credit card company prohibits the retailer from
   surcharging transactions using the company's card. This article develops
   a theory of vMFN restraints and applies it to credit cards. The vMFN
   clause harms competition among upstream suppliers, which raises price to
   a level even greater than the monopoly price. The vMFN clause can also
   be used to extract surplus from customers of products supplied
   competitively. Applying the theory to credit card antitrust cases, we
   find that the two-sided nature of the market does not mandate a new set
   of competition policy principles, contrary to the decision in Ohio v.
   American Express. Indeed, the economic literature on credit card
   networks as two-sided platforms rediscovers established principles of
   price theory.}},

Abstract = {{Using an exhaustive database of bookings in one large chain of hotels
   active in Oslo (2013-2016), we estimate a nested-logit demand model that
   allows us to evaluate substitution patterns between online distribution
   channels. Making use of the chain's decision to delist from Expedia's

Abstract = {{With the rapid development of information technology and network
   economy, innovative competition mode and profit mode come forth
   continuously. Website ranking service is a kind of pay-per-click (PPC)
   advertising offered by online search engine operators and is a new
   profit mode for e-marketing in the network economy era. It brings
   service providers much more profits. However, there are concerns that
   such website ranking service will create a space of commercial fraud and
   unfair competition, more and more corporations will be kidnapped by this
   marketing mode because of the market dominant position of Baidu.com in
   the Chinese search engine service industry. Therefore, lack of legal
   risk management for the search engine companies in this field has made
   the website ranking service a significant source of disputes. This
   article explores the legal problems arising from website ranking service
   by taking Baidu.com as a case, and discusses Internet service providers'
   legal liability under Chinese newly enforced Antitrust Law mainly. Then,
   this article tries to analyze other potential legal risks of Internet
   business under AML as an extensive thought from the discussion
   beforehand. Finally, this article puts forward some resolutions aiming
   at protecting the fair and efficient competition environment as well as
   the rights and interests of all parties.}},

Journal = {{ECONOMIC MODELLING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{65-71}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We study a firm's choice between online and physical markets with
   respect to product quality. We analyze two contrasting driving forces:
   On the one hand, online consumers cannot physically inspect the products
   prior to purchase. This provides the firm with the incentive to hide
   low-quality products online. On the other hand, consumer reviews and the
   larger market size may attract higher qualities to the online market.
   Using a simple yet flexible framework, we show that the firm's choice of
   a marketplace can disclose or hide product quality. If marginal cost is
   convex in quality, the firm's choice will be characterized by a cut-off
   quality level, below which the firm will choose the online market. If
   marginal cost is concave in quality, both high-end and low-end qualities
   may choose the online market, leaving the physical market to
   intermediate qualities. Overall, we show that consumer reviews can
   alleviate, but do not eliminate, the ``lemons problem{''}. The pooling
   result in the case of concave-in-quality marginal cost provides a caveat
   for empirically testing the effectiveness of online consumer-review
   mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMICS}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{607-626}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the effects of tying on market competition and
   social welfare in two-sided markets when economic agents can engage in
   multi-homing by participating in multiple platforms to reap maximal
   network benefits. The model shows that tying induces more consumers to
   multi-home and makes platform-specific exclusive content available to
   more consumers, which is beneficial to content providers. As a result,
   tying can be welfare-enhancing if multi-homing is allowed, even in cases
   where its welfare impacts are negative in the absence of multi-homing.
   The analysis thus can have important implications for recent antitrust
   cases in industries where multi-homing is prevalent.}},

Abstract = {{Since the seminal papers by Rochet and Tirole, the payment card industry
   has represented an elected field of study for the economic features of
   multisided markets and their effects on both regulation and antitrust
   analysis. The recent judgements of the UK High Court of Justice in
   MasterCard and of the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in
   American Express are particularly relevant because they are the first to
   concretely apply the economic theory of multisided markets to the
   payment card industry. In particular, given the nature of multisided
   markets, the coexistence of different business models, and the dualistic
   competitive interpretation of the conduct, courts have emphasised the
   need to articulate a judgement around counterfactual hypotheses. This is
   a way to measure the actual impact on competition, testing the realistic
   scenario that would occur if the investigated conduct was absent, so as
   to give appropriate consideration to the business model of the single
   platform. The same reasoning that makes us consider advantageous a
   flexible antitrust approach forces us to be critical of the current US
   and EU regulation of payment systems.}},

Abstract = {{Recent calls for using the antitrust laws to break up the large Internet
   giants are misplaced for a number of reasons. First, similar efforts
   against oil, tobacco, motion-picture, and telecommunications monopolies
   have not proved to be beneficial to economic welfare. Second, the
   failure to break up Microsoft using Section2 has not proved to be a
   mistake: competition in operating systems and Internet browsers has
   flourished recently. Finally, a Section2 case against Amazon, Facebook,
   or Google could not succeed if it focused on the digital advertising
   market. Even in a case based on market power on the other side of their
   platforms, a structural remedya break-upwould not improve economic
   welfare in the long run.}},

Abstract = {{We study concentration in the European Internet upstream access market.
   The possibility of measuring market concentration depends on a correct
   definition of the market itself; however, this is not always possible,
   because very often in the Internet industry antitrust authorities lack
   reliable pricing and traffic data. We present an alternative approach
   based on the inference of the Internet operators' interconnection
   policies using micro-data from their Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)
   tables. We assess market concentration following a two-step process:
   first, we propose a price-independent algorithm for defining both the
   vertical and geographical relevant market boundaries; then we calculate
   market concentration indexes using two novel metrics. These assess, for
   each undertaking, its role both in terms of essential network facility
   and of wholesale market dominance. The results, applied to four leading
   Internet exchange points in London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, and Milan,
   show that some vertical segments of these markets are highly
   concentrated, while others are extremely competitive. According to the
   Merger Guidelines, some of the estimated market concentration values
   would immediately fall within the special attention category.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze platform competition where user data is collected to improve
   ad-targeting. Considering that users incur privacy costs, we show that
   the equilibrium level of data provision is distorted and can be
   inefficiently high or low: if overall competition is weak or if
   targeting benefits are low, too much private data is collected, and
   vice-versa. Further, we find that softer competition on either market
   side leads to more data collection, which implies substitutability
   between competition policy measures on both market sides. Moreover, if
   platforms engage in two-sided pricing, data provision is efficient. (c)

   tackles this issue by looking at the specific condition laid out in

   requiring that a fair share of efficiency benefits must be passed on to
   consumers in order to justify an otherwise anticompetitive agreement.
   The implications of forbidding or allowing aggregation of efficiencies
   across markets are examined with reference to the two-sided market of

Abstract = {{This paper investigates who wins and who loses when firms depart from a
   mass advertising/uniform pricing strategy (bench-mark model) to a
   targeted advertising/price discrimination one. Considering a duopoly
   market in which firms simultaneously compete in prices and advertising
   decisions, we examine the competitive and welfare effects of
   personalized pricing with targeted advertising by comparing equilibrium
   outcomes under customized advertising/ pricing decisions to the results
   arising under mass advertising and uniform pricing. We show that, when
   both firms compete in both market segments, all segment consumers are
   expected to pay higher average prices under the personalized
   advertising/pricing strategy. We also show that, in the context of our
   simultaneous game, targeted advertising with price discrimination might
   boost firms' profits in comparison to the case of mass advertising and
   uniform prices. The overall welfare effects of the personalized strategy
   are ambiguous. However, even when the personalized strategy boosts
   overall welfare, consumers might all be worse-off. Thus the paper gives
   support to concerns that have been raised re-garding the firms' ability
   to adopt personalized strategies to boost profits at the expense of
   consumers. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper shows that two related aspects of attention platforms are
   important for the sound economic analysis of public policy including
   antitrust: first, attention platforms generate valuable content. Even
   though people often don't pay for content, we know from revealed
   preference that content is valuable because people spend a considerable
   amount of timewhich has an opportunity costconsuming it. Second, demand
   for advertising and the supply of content are interdependent. A decrease
   in the demand for advertising reduces the returns to supplying content
   and therefore the amount of content that is provided. Accounting for the
   value of content and these positive feedbacks cannot determine optimal
   interventions; but failing to do so can result in policies that reduce
   consumeras well as advertiserwelfare. The paper then considers the
   implications of these considerations for public policy: particularly
   privacy regulation and antitrust enforcement. From the standpoint of
   promoting consumer welfare, the failure to account for the value of
   content and the ad-content interdependencies increases the chances that
   authorities do not intervene when they should and do intervene when they
   should not.}},

Abstract = {{Many online businesses seek and provide attention. These online
   attention rivals provide products and features to obtain the attention
   of consumers and sell some of that attention, through other products and
   services, to merchants, developers, and others who value it. The
   multi-sided business of seeking and providing attention is fluid with
   rivalries crossing boundaries defined by the features of the products
   and services. It is also dynamic. Rivals introduce new products and
   services, some involving drastic and frequent innovation. Online
   attention rivals impose competitive constraints on one another. Product
   differentiation tempers the significance of these constraints in
   particular situations. But the relevant differentiation mainly involves
   aspects of the attention that is procured and sold rather than,
   necessarily, particular features of the products and services used for
   acquiring and delivering that attention. Antitrust analysis should
   consider these competitive constraints in evaluating market definition,
   market power, and the potential for anticompetitive effects. The
   existence of competition among attention rivals does not imply that
   antitrust should reduce the vigor with which it examines mergers and
   exclusionary practices among these platforms. It just needs to look for
   problems in the right places.}},

   components of the diagnostic system are distinguished: dominance,
   concentration based on market shares, concentration based on market
   prices, general cooperation and episodic (or seasonal) cooperation. As a
   basic concept for the detecting of cooperative behavior, we used
   conjectural variations approach. In our opinion, it uses a relatively
   small number of a priori assumptions about interactions between market
   agents, which is important for empirical research. Mathematical models
   are considered for calculating the level of cooperation, allowing to
   analyze the degree of use of market power in a static and dynamic
   aspects. The proposed diagnostic system can be used by government,
   antitrust and regulatory authorities to monitor the level of competition
   in retail markets and identify signs of price cooperation. In turn, the
   same methods can also help market agents to analyze their pricing
   policy, to prove the fact of fair competitive behavior and to adjust
   pricing in a timely manner.}},

Abstract = {{Digital transformation is a source of new and changed business models
   that change market conditions. Digital platforms facilitate access to
   global market for enterprises of all sizes. However, taking a dominant
   position in the market and abusing the market power of digital platforms
   are common forms of distortion of competition. The aim of this paper is
   to investigate the impact of digital platforms on competition. Based on
   a critical approach and grouping of alternative attitudes around market
   regulation and competition, a model was developed in which key problems
   and potential solutions were highlighted, as well as the wider effects
   of competition protection in the digital market. The conclusion of the
   analysis indicates that it is necessary to develop new tools and
   criteria for market analysis, ensure greater control over supervision of
   acquisitions, encourage information sharing both among market
   participants and with the Government, revise public procurement rules
   and introduce customized quality standards. The importance of a
   supportive competitive environment is emphasized.}},

Abstract = {{The Department of Justice recent case against Microsoft is that it
   should not be allowed to aggressively maintain control over the internet
   browser market with the objective of preventing the internet from
   becoming the platform that could ultimately destroy Microsoft's
   operating system market. The aim of this paper is not to attack the
   Department of Justice case. Rather, it is to argue that for consumers
   one monopoly dominating both the operating system and applications is
   better than two separate monopolies. In our model we integrate Cournot's
   theory of two goods that are jointly used in the production of a third
   composite good with the fixed-proportion model. Utilizing our model we
   develop a possible explanation for Microsoft's actions - protection of
   its monopoly profits in the operating systems package market.
   Additionally we show that the price of the final product is lower if one
   firm monopolizes all markets. Consequently, the ordered split-up of
   Microsoft by Judge Thomas P. Jackson, aiming at creating two separate
   companies, one that will produce the windows and the other the operating
   systems, will harm consumers.}},

Abstract = {{Firms often sell a basic good as well as ancillary ones. Hold-up
   concerns have led to ancillary good regulations, such as transparency
   and price caps. The hold-up narrative, however, runs counter to evidence
   in many retail settings where ancillary good prices are set below cost
   (e.g., free shipping or limited card surcharging in countries where the
   ``no-surcharge rule{''} was lifted). We argue that the key to unifying
   these conflicting narratives is that the seller may absorb partly or
   fully the ancillary good's cost so as not to miss sales on the basic
   good. A supplier with market power on the ancillary good market then
   takes advantage of cost absorption and jacks up its wholesale price.
   Hold-ups occur only when consumers are initially uninformed or naive
   about the drip price and shopping costs are high. The price of the basic
   good then acts as a signal of the drip price, since a high markup on the
   basic good makes the firm more wary of missed sales. Regardless of
   whether consumers are informed, uninformed but rational, or naive,
   mandating price transparency and banning loss-making on the ancillary
   good leads to (i) an efficient consumption of the ancillary good, and
   (ii) a reduction of its wholesale price, generating strict welfare
   gains.}},

Abstract = {{As the fate of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) hangs in balance, an
   evaluation of what it offers could inform current decisions and shape
   future negotiations. The TPP's services component has been hailed as one
   of the agreement's major accomplishments. To assess the agreement's
   impact on national policy in the major services sectors, we created a
   new public database. This database reveals that TPP commitments seldom
   go beyond countries' applied policies, suggesting the explicit
   liberalization resulting from the agreement is limited only to a few
   countries and a few areas. However, the TPP enhances transparency and
   policy certainty because parties' services commitments cover more
   trading partners, more sectors and are in some cases closer to applied
   policies than their commitments under previous agreements. Furthermore,
   new TPP rules, including on state-owned enterprises, government
   procurement and competition policy, could enhance services market
   access. In particular, the TPP breaks new ground in prohibiting
   restrictions on international data flows, while at the same time
   creating unprecedented obligations on all parties to protect consumers
   from fraud and protect privacy. These dual obligations on importing and
   exporting countries represent a model for regulatory cooperation that
   could elicit greater market opening if applied to other areas.}},

Abstract = {{Can industrial policy be good policy? Can it be market-conforming (not
   producing market distortions via misallocation of resources) and
   market-ensuring (e.g. via antitrust or enforcement of property rights)?
   Can it create a smaller market distortion to prevent a larger one that
   might result from political ferment? This chapter explores issues of the
   definition of industrial policy, discusses market failure vs. government
   failure in specific industries, contrasts the options for industrial
   policy in regulatory states with those available in developmental
   states, and provides examples to illustrate these issues based on the
   author's empirical research on biotechnology, high definition and
   digital television, flat panel displays, semiconductors, software, and
   cellular telephones.}},

Abstract = {{Alfred E. Kahn was an observer and practitioner of telecommunications
   regulation as technology changed the industry from a natural monopoly to
   a platform-based oligopoly among telephone, cable, satellite, and
   wireless carriers. Regulation and legislation were slow to recognize
   these changes, and large welfare losses occurred, some of which could
   have been avoided if regulators, legislators and economists had followed
   Fred's economic advice: Prices must be informed by costs; the relevant
   costs are actual incremental costs; costs and prices are an outcome of a
   Schumpeterian competitive process, not the starting point; excluding
   firms from markets is fundamentally anticompetitive; a reliance on
   imperfect markets subject to antitrust law is preferable to necessarily
   imperfect regulation; and a regulatory transition to deregulation
   entails propensities to micromanage the process to generate preferred
   outcomes, visible competitors, and expedient price reductions.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the consumer-welfare implications of Google's project to scan
   a large proportion of the world's books into digital form and to make
   these works accessible to consumers through Google Book Search (GBS). In
   response to a class action alleging copyright infringement, Google has
   agreed to a settlement with the plaintiffs, which include the Authors
   Guild and the Association of American Publishers. A federal district
   court must approve the settlement for it to take effect. Various
   individuals and organizations have advocated modification or rejection
   of the settlement, based in part on concerns regarding Google's claimed
   ability to exercise market power. The Antitrust Division has confirmed
   that it is investigating the settlement. We address concerns of
   Professor Randal Picker and others, especially concerns over the
   increased access to ``orphan books,{''} which are books that retain
   their copyright but for which the copyright holders are unknown or
   cannot be found. The increased accessibility of orphan books under GBS
   involves the creation of a new product, which entails large gains in
   consumer welfare. We consider it unlikely that Google could exercise
   market power over orphan books. We consider it remote that the static
   efficiency losses claimed by critics of the settlement could outweigh
   the consumer welfare gains from the creation of a valuable new service
   for expanding access to orphan books. We therefore conclude that neither
   antitrust intervention nor price regulation of access to orphan books
   under GBS would be justified on economic grounds.}},

Abstract = {{The US residential broadband market is commonly characterized as a
   duopoly consisting of telephone carriers (digital subscriber lines) and
   cable TV operators (cable modems). The implication is drawn that market
   power obtains; this, in turn, drives recommendations for new competition
   policy remedies. Yet, market power cannot be directly deduced from
   market shares or price-cost margins. We develop an economic analysis
   that examines both static and dynamic factors in considering market
   power, finding that fixed broadband providers do not appear to generate
   supra-competitive returns. Public policies to regulate broadband
   providers should be informed by these marketplace conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) is a recently-formed division
   of the Patent Office in which patents can be challenged as invalid, and
   which differs from federal courts in a number of respects. We
   investigate whether monopolist-patentees and their prospective rivals
   are using the PTAB which has not previously received antitrust attention
   as a platform for striking settlements that delay the rivals' entry.
   Such settlements are common in pharmaceutical markets, and are typically
   antitrust violations in cases where the patentee pays the challenger
   ({''}pay for delay{''}). However, problematic statutory inducements lead
   to excessively-delayed competition even in lieu of such payments. Our
   empirical findings suggest that delayed entry settlements are now
   commonly executed in the PTAB, and that they comprise a large majority
   of all PTAB settlements reached between pharmaceutical rivals. Further,
   nearly half of the delayed entry settlements were reached after the
   relevant patent claims were deemed ``reasonably likely{''} to be
   invalid. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For three decades after liberation in 1949, the Chinese economy
   consisted almost entirely of state monopolies. Economic reforms,
   starting in 1979, sought to increase the efficiency of the economy by
   introducing competitive practices in many sectors of the economy. But
   the Chinese economy has been partially administered by the state for
   over two millennia. As a result, both state-managed and private
   monopolies are still an intrinsic part of the Chinese economy today.
   Despite two decades of anti-monopoly reforms, state-owned enterprises
   (SOEs) continue to dominate key sectors of the economy, particularly in
   resource extraction and financial services. The government is aware of
   the inefficiencies and corruption caused by monopolies, both public and
   private. But Chinese tradition takes a balanced view of social harms and
   weighs the damage caused by monopoly against the stability that SOEs
   have provided China in recent decades. There is less reason for China to
   tolerate private monopolies, but most of them have arisen in conjunction
   with digital technology because of its distinctive cost structure (high
   entry costs, low marginal costs). China has made some use of antitrust
   law, but most economic regulation in China is administrative. Thus the
   anti-monopoly activities that are used to restrain monopoly power in
   China are different from Western practices.}},

Title = {{The Google search case in Europe: tying and the single monopoly profit
   theorem in two-sided markets}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{15-42}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This paper provides an economic and legal theory of harm applicable to
   the case against Google in Europe over search bias. So far, no clear
   legal and economic theory has yet been delineated by the European
   Commission, nor consensus in the literature has emerged with regard to
   the theory of foreclosure that could support the case, or with regard to
   the specific form of abuse of dominance applicable under European law.
   The paper shows that the law and economics of tying applies to search
   bias. From a legal standpoint, it is not necessary to rely on the more
   formalistic elements of Article 102 TFEU, or to characterize Google as
   an essential facility, in order to find a valid legal theory of harm. We
   show that Google's conduct of linking its proprietary vertical (or
   specialized) search platforms to its horizontal (or general) search
   platform through visual prominence, as it has done with Google Shopping,
   fits within the legal boundaries of tying under European law. From an
   economic perspective, we show that the two-sided nature of both
   horizontal and vertical search provides compelling reasons why
   foreclosure of competition may be profitable, and why the single
   monopoly profit theorem may fail in this context. As we show in the
   paper, by tying vertical search to general search through visual
   prominence, Google can attract additional advertisers on its vertical
   search platform that would have possibly advertised on competing
   vertical search platforms without a tie. The effect of tying is a
   restriction on competition in vertical search that deserves antitrust
   scrutiny.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{I analyze a model of dynamic competition between retail platforms in the
   presence of consumer lock-in. Two different revenue models are
   considered, one in which platforms set final retail prices and one in
   which the suppliers set final retail prices. Platforms have long-term
   (or strategic) pricing incentives but suppliers do not, which implies
   that the inter-temporal price path faced by consumers depends on the
   revenue model in place. When suppliers set prices instead of platforms,
   prices may be higher in early periods but lower in later periods,
   suggesting that appropriate antitrust enforcement ought to consider more
   than initial price changes when an industry shifts to the agency model.
   Indeed, consumers may (but need not) prefer the agency model even when
   prices increase in initial periods. A potential downside of the agency
   model is that it may align the incentives of suppliers and platforms and
   thereby encourage platforms to lower the competitiveness of the supplier
   market, harming consumers; no such incentives exist under the wholesale
   model. I relate my results to events in the market for electronic books.

Abstract = {{Although the economics of multisided platforms has developed important
   insights for antitrust policy, there are critical respects in which the
   body of academic knowledge falls short of providing useful advice to
   enforcement agencies and the courts. Indeed, there is a substantial risk
   that recent scholarship will be misapplied to the detriment of sound
   antitrust policy, as evidenced by the US Supreme Court's recent decision
   in American Express. In this note, I identify several areas in which
   economics research could potentially make significant contributions to
   the practical antitrust treatment of platforms.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the influence of firms' ability to employ individualized
   pricing on the welfare consequences of horizontal mergers. In a
   two-to-one merger, the merger reduces consumer surplus more when firms
   can price discriminate based on individual preferences compared to when
   they cannot. However, the opposite holds true in a three-to-two merger,
   in which the reduction in consumer surplus is substantially lower with
   individualized pricing than with uniform pricing. Further, the merger
   requires an even smaller marginal cost reduction to justify when an
   upstream data provider can make exclusive offers for its data to
   downstream firms. We also show that exclusive contracts for consumer
   data pose significant antitrust concerns independent of merger
   considerations. Implications for vertical integration and data mergers
   are drawn.}},

Abstract = {{Despite its long history in antitrust policy, predation remains a poorly
   understood phenomenon. The main difficulty is in empirically identifying
   predatory intent. I propose a method for measuring the effect of
   reputation, whose significance would enable us to infer predatory
   intents. Maximum likelihood estimation using simulated annealing
   algorithm is conducted with a sample of US airline markets. The results
   provide some support for the presence of entrants learning and
   reputation effect. As an application, I discuss how the outcomes of my
   empirical model could help analyze such antitrust cases as the American
   Airlines Case. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   show that in such a market structure the stronger the competition
   between the TV channels, the greater will joint profits in the TV

   wholesale contract between each TV channel and the distributor consists
   of a simple fixed fee rather than a two-part tariff. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The aim of the research is to identify the patterns and role of state
   monopoly policies in the development of Chinese state and society. It
   provides a comparative analysis of the Chinese government's policy in
   the field of monopolies in history and at the present stage.
   State monopolies have played an important role and have had significant
   political and economic influence throughout history in China. One of the
   China's monopolies which has a great influence on the high-tech
   production market is the monopoly on rare earth metals (REM). Control
   over this market increases the dependence of other countries on China
   and allows the use of this dependence in foreign policy processes. The
   second monopoly, Panda monopoly, is also used as an instrument of
   foreign policy to express friendly intentions and willingness to
   cooperate. Along with this, a number of monopolies are undergoing
   transformational processes in China. For example, one of the oldest
   monopolies in the world - the monopoly of China on salt - was dismantled
   in 2017, the Chinese government is preparing to abolish the state
   monopoly on oil and gas mining and production in 2020.
   The Internet market trends discussed in the article indicate the
   presence of monopolies in the Internet space and the need to build new
   antitrust policy in the digital sphere.}},

Abstract = {{We study the price and welfare effects of collusion between two-sided
   platforms and show that they depend on whether collusion occurs on both
   sides or a single side of the market, and whether users single-home or
   multi-home. Our most striking result is that one-sided collusion leads
   to lower (resp. higher) prices on the collusive (resp. competitive) side
   if the cross-group externalities exerted on the collusive side are
   positive and sufficiently strong. One-sided collusion may, therefore,
   benefit the users on the collusive side and harm the users on the
   competitive side. Our findings have implications regarding cartel
   detection and damages actions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We analyze a search engine market from a law and economics perspective
   and incorporate the choice of quality-improving innovations by a search
   engine platform in a two-sided model of Internet search engine. In the
   proposed framework, we first discuss the legal issues the search engine
   market raises for antitrust policy through analysis of several types of
   abusive behavior by the dominant platform. We also explore possible
   consequences of monopolization of the search engine market for
   advertisers and users in the form of excessive pricing and deterioration
   of the quality of the search results. Second, in the technical analysis
   part, we incorporate these considerations in a two-sided market model
   and analyze the rate of innovation, pricing, and quality choices by the
   dominant search engine. Our findings show that a dominant monopoly
   platform results in higher prices and underinvestment in
   quality-improving innovations by a search engine relative to the social
   optimum. More generally, we show that monopoly is sub-optimal in terms
   of harm to advertisers in the form of excessive prices, harm to users in
   the form of reduction in quality of search results, as well as harm to
   the society in the form of lower innovation rates in the industry.}},

Title = {{Digital monopolies: Privacy protection or price regulation?}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{71}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Increasing returns to scale in data gathering and processing give rise
   to a new form of monopoly, referred to here as digital monopoly. Digital
   monopolies create new challenges for regulators and antitrust
   authorities. We address two in this paper: market power arising from
   improved match values and from reduced privacy. The digital monopoly's
   profit and social surplus always increase as privacy decreases. However,
   consumer surplus is non-monotone in privacy. Without privacy, the match
   value is perfect but completely extracted by the digital monopoly. In
   contrast, as privacy goes to infinity, match values and social surplus
   go to zero. With regulated prices, consumer surplus is maximized without
   privacy protection. As with natural monopolies, price regulation thus
   remains an appropriate tool in the digital age to capture the social
   benefits from increasing returns to scale without harming consumers. (C)

Abstract = {{Probably not, is the short answer to that question. Unlike other
   platforms, such as operating systems, credit cards, or even nightclubs,
   where a single transaction is performed via the platform, two different
   transactions take place on Google. Users perform searches in exchange
   for personal data, while advertisers seek users attentionuto be matched
   with the right user. Whereas operating systems, credit cards, and
   nightclubs would cease to exist if either of the two sides were missing,
   search engines (rather like TV or newspapers) can exist under different
   market configurations. Indeed, in search engines, network externalities
   run only from the number of users to advertisers, not the other way
   around. Building upon this analysis, a non-bilateral construction of the
   relevant market where Google operates is proposed. Google operates as a
   retailer of users personal information. In the upstream market, it buys
   users personal information from large retailers and final consumers in
   exchange for search services, or upon monetary payment. It then uses the
   personal information collected to sell targeted advertising to
   advertisers in the downstream market. Based on this market construction,
   the allegations against Google are analyzed as alleged violations of
   competition law along this vertical chain.}},

   personal data (privacy) on competition, and to investigate to which
   extent privacy is complementary or opposed to antitrust policy. First,
   we highlight the role of the costs faced by consumers due to privacy
   regulation, including the consent costs occuring when consumers want to
   use an online service. Second, we extend Campbell, Goldfarb et Tucker
   (2015]'s model on the advertising-supported Internet by introducing
   different consent costs. We show that, in some cases, firms may prefer
   to exclude high-consent consumers from the market, so as to target the
   remaining consumers.}},

Abstract = {{The 1965 legislation to curb restrictive trade practices has been widely
   regarded as weak. By contrast, the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) has
   been considered as providing the platform for a more comprehensive
   competition policy. This paper argues that the 1965-67 and 1971 Acts
   were more effective than has been commonly recognised in raising
   awareness about the extent of restrictive trade practices, discrediting
   price agreements and laying the foundations for the 1974 Act. The role
   of Ron Bannerman, the sole Commissioner of Trade Practices, was critical
   to their success. This paper uses parliamentary debates, Bannerman's
   published works and an interview with him undertaken in early 2005.}},

Title = {{Facing the climate and digital challenge: European energy industry from
   boom to crisis and transformation}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{330-343}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This article contributes to the understanding of the current
   transformation of the energy industry in Europe and the interplay
   between greening policies and digital technological innovation.
   It shows how, since the financial crisis, core players in the European
   energy industry ended up in a dualist limbo, between conventional and
   emerging business models. It documents how strategies and business
   models that delivered extraordinary financial performance in the first
   decade of the 21st century often failed dramatically after the 2008
   financial crisis. Yet it finds that incumbents with 1) a greener energy
   mix, 2) smaller scale and, quite naturally, 3) better financial
   performance fared better than others
   The study explores the emergence of new business models and finds that
   most of the emerging business models circle around the customer
   interface where digital solutions allow more flexible interplay between
   consumption and production of energy, and/or between several service
   alternatives to fulfill basic needs for customer home comfort.
   The article also discusses important policy implications: For
   competition policy, it indicates a shift from challenges of scale and
   scope towards challenges of regulating networks and dominant platforms.
   Furthermore, it highlights new policy dilemmas concerning balancing and
   energy storage to accommodate intermittent supply from renewables.}},

Abstract = {{This research focuses on approaches to competition regulation of digital
   platforms, which are presented as systems with market structure and
   transaction network. The characteristic features of digital platforms
   are marked, the main instruments of obtaining and holding market power,
   forms of abuse of dominant position in the relevant market are marked.
   On the basis of a synthesis of scientific research and existing practice
   in handling antitrust cases, the principal provisions for regulating
   digital platforms are shown. It is noted that the division of digital
   platforms into transactional and nontransactional allows to determine
   the number of relevant markets that are affected by the actions of the
   platform. A number of platform digital properties have been identified
   that are important for assessing the boundaries of relevant markets.
   Special attention is paid to identifying the dominant position of the
   digital platform based on the analysis of a number of related
   conditions: consolidation of large data, the impact of network effects;
   economies of scale. The role of analysis}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the proposed settlement agreement between Google
   and the Authors Guild relating to Google Book Search (GBS). I focus on
   three issues that raise antitrust and competition policy concerns.
   First, the agreement calls for Google to act as agent for rightsholders
   in setting the price of online access to consumers. Google is tasked
   with developing a pricing algorithm that will maximize revenues for each
   of those works. Direct competition among rightsholders would push prices
   towards some measure of costs and would not be designed to maximize
   revenues. The consumer access pricing provision might very well fail a
   challenge under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Second, and much more
   centrally to the settlement agreement, the opt-out class action will
   make it possible for Google to include orphan works in its book search
   service. Orphan works are works as to which the rightsholder cannot be
   identified or found. The opt-out class action is the vehicle for
   large-scale collective action by active rightsholders. Active
   rightsholders have little incentive to compete with themselves by
   granting multiple licenses of their works or of the orphan works. Plus
   under the terms of the settlement agreement, active rightsholders
   benefit directly from the revenues attributable to orphan works used in
   GBS. We can mitigate the market power that will otherwise arise through
   the settlement by expanding the number of rights licenses available
   under the settlement agreement. To do that, we should take the step of
   unbundling the orphan works deal from the overall settlement agreement
   and create a separate license to use those works. All of that will
   undoubtedly add more complexity to what is already a large piece of
   work, and it may make sense to push out the new licenses to the future.
   That would mean ensuring now that the court retains jurisdiction to do
   that and/or giving the new registry created in the settlement the power
   to do this sort of licensing. Third, there is a risk that approval by
   the court of the settlement could cause antitrust immunities to attach
   to the arrangements created by the settlement agreement. As it is highly
   unlikely that the fairness hearing will undertake a meaningful antitrust
   analysis of those arrangements, if the district court approves the
   settlement, the court should include a clause-call this a no Noerr
   clause-in the order approving the settlement providing that no antitrust
   immunities attach from the court's approval.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, international insolvency laws have been constantly
   renewed, with two major imbalances: the pressure of legislative
   harmonization and adaptation to national specificities. The tendency to
   harmonize the field of insolvency is the result of both institutional
   cooperation at international or regional level and informal compliance
   pressures from other partner countries.
   A number of international institutions (IMF, World Bank, UNCITRAL,
   European Commission, etc.) have defined recommendations, conventions,
   consultation mechanisms or other cooperation arrangements in recent
   years to establish common practices in insolvency proceedings. These
   institutional mechanisms have directly addressed the field of
   insolvency, but also indirectly, through regulations or related
   agreements, in areas such as competition policy.
   The area where an advanced harmonization exercise has been achieved has
   been the one of cross-border insolvency cooperation. In this case, both
   at the European Union and at the international level, there were
   mandatory and voluntary regulations that strengthened the international
   cooperation platform on insolvency in the light of the company's
   restructuring plan.
   The purpose of our study is to analyze the nature and characteristics of
   the legal status of the insolvency institution in the light of the
   company's restructuring plan.}},

Abstract = {{The rapid growth of online search and its centrality to the ecology of
   the Internet pose important questions: why is the search engine market
   so concentrated, and will it evolve towards monopoly? What implications
   does this concentration have for consumers, search engines, and
   advertisers? Does search require regulation, and, if so, in what form?
   This paper supplies empirical and theoretical material with which to
   examine these questions. In particular, we (a) show that the already
   large levels of concentration are likely to continue; (b) identify the
   consequences, negative and positive, of this outcome; and (c) discuss
   the regulatory interventions that policy-makers could use to address
   these.}},

Abstract = {{The populist use of competition policies is on the rise again,
   associated with the growth of big-tech companies in the era of digital

   in the United States and Europe via greater politicisation of
   competition law enforcement. It addresses the basic tenets of antitrust
   populism in order to expose the fundamental problems that populist use
   of competition law entails. I argue for a rethink of antitrust policy on
   the intellectual foundations laid down by what Mark Pennington describes
   as `robust political economy'. We need greater regulatory humility and
   antitrust enforcement which takes both innovation and welfare seriously.}},

   and its final signing in 2017. Political and economic objectives of the
   Agreement are of fundamental importance to the future of both Ukraine
   and the whole European region. The political goal is to implement
   European standards on the territory of Ukraine. This implies the
   introduction of fundamental European values, namely democracy, rule of
   law, respect for human rights and the standards of the European security
   system. The Agreement does not foresee membership in the European Union,
   however, does not exclude such an opportunity in the future. The
   economic goal is to help to modernize the Ukrainian economy by expanding
   trade volumes with the EU and other countries, as well as reforming
   economic regulation mechanisms in line with the best European practices.
   Subject to the improvement of the business climate, Ukraine will become
   attractive for foreign and domestic investment for further production
   for export to the EU and other markets of the world. Harmonization of
   standards and European regulations has become a much more important
   process than the fulfilment of strictly technical requirements and
   underlies the introduction of effective governance without corruption.
   In the process of harmonization of interaction, an adaptive
   institutional mechanism was formed (the highest level - annual Summits;
   the key coordinator is the Association Council, consisting of members of
   the Council of the European Union and members of the European
   Commission, and members of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine; the
   level of operational coordination - the Association Parliamentary
   Committee, which includes members of the European Parliament,
   representatives of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine, and the Civil Society
   Platform; in order to coordinate processes on the territory of Ukraine,
   the Ukrainian government has introduced a few supervisory committees and
   commissions). The harmonization of the economic aspect of the mechanism
   has been determined in solving issues of openness of markets for
   duty-free import from Ukraine in April 2014, obtaining a visa-free
   regime with the EU, abolishing export-import tariffs, implementing
   European technical standards for food safety, phytosanitary norms,
   competition policy, service provision, and public procurement policy.
   The issues of further deepening of relations include a review of the
   terms for the introduction of regulations and legislative provisions
   before their actual implementation, stabilization of financial and
   economic processes in the country, and further development of democratic
   values and social institutions.}},

Abstract = {{Innovation is vital to competition, consumer welfare and long-term
   economic growth. It has great societal benefits which should be promoted
   and protected. It is understood that innovation consists of several
   fundamental elements: creativity, risk-taking, value-addition, adoption,
   and destruction. Combing these elements allows for powerful new
   technologies to develop and change the way people travel, work and
   interact. Given this, a question arises as to whether and how
   competition law can protect and foster innovation in the digital sector.
   The aim of this article is to identify the challenges posed by
   innovation to competition law by demonstrating the difficulties of
   applying competition law to digital markets. The article also seeks to
   determine the role competition policy plays in ensuring innovation
   especially in securing access to competitively important data or
   preventing mergers that eliminate future rivals. Finally, the article
   suggests how the identified problems can be accurately solved and what
   has so far been achieved in this respect.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{``Paperless Ticketing{''} refers to a transaction where the purchaser
   uses her credit card to get into an event instead of having a ticket,
   pdf, or mobile phone scanable file. As implemented by TicketMaster, the
   secondary or resale market of tickets originally sold by TicketMaster
   must go through TicketMasters own resale site, TicketExchange (or its
   wholly owned sister site, TicketsNow). Preventing other platforms like
   StubHub, RazorGator, and the like from being used severely limits the
   resale market. In an empirical study of over 1,600 tickets, some sold as
   Paperless Ticketing tickets and others sold as conventional tickets, the
   price in the secondary market for the Paperless Ticketing tickets was
   nearly \$100 higher than comparable conventional tickets sold. In
   addition, the quantity of Paperless Ticketing tickets available and sold
   in the secondary market relative to comparable conventional tickets was
   about 10 percent. In other words, the supply of Paperless Ticketing
   tickets available for sale in the secondary market was much lower and
   the prices were much higher. This is consistent with the theoretical
   findings, and standard economics findings, of downstream attempted
   monopolization by an upstream supplier.}},

Abstract = {{Google has been accused of manipulating its organic search results to
   favor its own services. We explore possible choices of relevant
   antitrust markets that might make these various antitrust allegations
   meaningful. We argue that viewing Internet search in isolation ignores
   the two-sided nature of the search-advertising platform and the feedback
   effects that link the provision of organic search results to consumers
   on the one hand, and the sale to businesses of advertising on the other.
   We conclude that the relevant market in which Google competes with
   respect to Internet search is at least as broad as a two-sided
   search-advertising market. We also ask whether Google has a duty to
   provide organic search results that are neutral with respect to whether
   the displayed listing is for a Google rather than a non-Google business.
   We articulate and apply a standard that asks whether various practices
   related to Google's organic search results would harm competition that
   would have otherwise occurred.}},

   one-sided market framework and tools. While discussions of antitrust
   tools can be found in specialized forums devoted to advances in
   competition policy analysis, we organize the material in an integrated

   Distributions and a City-Wide Joint Distribution}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a solution to the problem of estimating a joint
   distribution using the associated marginal distributions and a related
   joint distribution. The particular application we have in mind is
   estimating joint distributions of demographic characteristics
   corresponding to market areas for individual retail stores. Marginal
   distributions are generally available at the census tract level, but
   joint distributions are only available for Metropolitan Statistical
   Areas which are generally much larger than the market for a single
   retail store. Joint distributions over demographics are an important
   input into mixed logit demand models for aggregate data. Market shares
   that vary systematically with demographics are essential for relieving
   the restrictions imposed by the Independence from Irrelevant Alternative
   property of the logit model.
   We approach this problem by formulating a parametric function that
   incorporates both the city-wide joint distributional information and
   marginal information specific to the retail store's market area. To
   estimate the function, we form moment conditions equating the moments of
   the parametric function to observed data, and we input these into a GMM
   objective.
   In one of our illustrations we use four marginal demographic
   distributions from each of eight stores in Dominick's Finer Foods data
   archive to estimate a four dimensional joint distribution for each
   store. Our results show that our GMMapproach produces estimated joint
   distributions that differ substantially from the product of marginal
   distributions and emit marginals that closely match the observed
   marginal distributions. Mixed logit demand estimates are also presented
   which show the estimates to be sensitive to the formulation of the
   demographics distribution.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we show that stable outcomes exist in matching
   environments with complementarities, such as social media platforms or
   markets for patent licenses. Our results apply to both nontransferable
   and transferable utility settings, and allow for multilateral agreements
   and those with externalities. In particular, we show that stable
   outcomes in these settings are characterized by the largest fixed point
   of a monotone operator, and so can be found using an algorithm; in the
   nontransferable utility case, this is aone-sideddeferred acceptance
   algorithm, rather than a Gale-Shapley algorithm. We also give a monotone
   comparative statics result as well as a comparative static on the effect
   of bundling contracts together. These illustrate the impact of design
   decisions, such as increased privacy protections on social media, or the
   use of antitrust law to disallow patent pools, on stable outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{Broadly speaking, a two-sided market is one in which 1) two sets of
   agents interact through an intermediary or platform, and 2) the
   decisions of each set of agents affects the outcomes of the other set of
   agents, typically through an externality. In the case of a video game
   system, for instance PlayStation, the intermediary is the console
   producer - Sony - while the two sets of agents are consumers and video
   game developers. Neither consumers nor game developers will be
   interested in the PlayStation if the other party is not. Similarly, a
   successful payment card requires both consumer usage and merchant
   acceptance, where both consumers and merchants value each others'
   participation. Many more products fit into this paradigm, such as search
   engines, newspapers, and almost any advertiser-supported media (examples
   in which consumers typically negatively value, rather than positively
   value, the participation of the other side), as well as most software or
   title-based operating systems and consumer electronics. This paper seeks
   to explain what two-sided markets are and why they interest economists.
   I discuss the strategies that firms typically consider, and I highlight
   a number of puzzling outcomes from the perspective of the economics of
   two-sided markets. Finally, I consider the implications for public
   policy, particularly antitrust and regulatory policy, where there have
   been a number of recent issues involving media, computer operating
   systems, and payment cards.}},

Abstract = {{Digital transformation has led to changes in business models of
   traditional players in the existing markets. What is more, new entrants
   and new markets appeared, in particular platforms and multisided
   markets. The emergence and rapid development of platforms are caused
   primarily by the existence of so called indirect network externalities.
   Regarding to this, a question arises of whether the existing instruments
   of competition law enforcement and market analysis are still relevant
   when analyzing markets with digital platforms? This paper aims at
   discussing advantages and disadvantages of using various tools to define
   markets with platforms. In particular, we define the features of the
   SSNIP test when being applyed to markets with platforms. Furthermore, we
   analyze adjustment in tests for platform market definition in terms of
   possible type I and type II errors. All in all, it turns out that to
   reduce the likelihood of type I and type II errors while applying market
   definition technique to markets with platforms one should consider the
   type of platform analyzed: transaction platforms without pass-through
   and non-transaction matching platforms should be tackled as players in a
   multisided market, whereas non-transaction platforms should be analyzed
   as players in several interrelated markets. However, if the platform is
   allowed to adjust prices, there emerges additional challenge that the
   regulator and companies may manipulate the results of SSNIP test by
   applying different models of competition.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the effect of tied-in sales by an essential goods
   monopolist in a two-sided market. In a two-sided market, the essential
   goods monopolist may tie a good essential for users, such as an
   operating system, with a platform, such as a media player, in the user
   side of the market, to extract profits not from the user side, but from
   the developer side of the market. From this simple idea, we build a
   simple two-sided market model and show how the essential goods
   monopolist may tie a platform with the essential goods on the user side
   of the market to foreclose a rival firm from the developer side of the
   market. We also analyze various welfare impacts of tying and discuss the

Title = {{A CONSUMER-WELFARE APPROACH TO NETWORK NEUTRALITY REGULATION OF THE
   INTERNET}},

Year = {{2006}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{3}},

Abstract = {{``Network neutrality{''} is the shorthand for a proposed regime of
   economic regulation for the Internet. Because of the trend to deliver
   traditional telecommunications services, as well as new forms of content
   and applications, by Internet protocol (IP), a regime of network
   neutrality regulation would displace or subordinate a substantial
   portion of existing telecommunications regulation. If the United States
   adopts network neutrality regulation, other industrialized nations
   probably will soon follow. As a result of their investment to create
   next-generation broadband networks, network operators have the ability
   to innovate inside the network by offering both senders and receivers of
   information greater bandwidth and prioritization of delivery. Network
   neutrality regulation would, among other things, prevent providers of
   broadband Internet access service (such as digital subscriber line (DSL)
   or cable modem service) from offering a guaranteed, expedited delivery
   speed in return for the payment of a fee. The practical effect of
   banning such differential pricing (called ``access tiering{''} by its
   critics) would be to prevent the pricing of access to content or
   applications providers according to priority of delivery. To the extent
   that an advertiser of a good or service would be willing to contract
   with a network operator for advertising space on the network operator's
   affiliated content, another practical effect of network neutrality
   regulation would be to erect a barrier to vertical integration of
   network operators into advertising-based business models that could
   supplement or replace revenues earned from their existing usage-based
   business models. Moreover, by making end-users pay for the full cost of
   broadband access, network neutrality regulation would deny broadband
   access to the large number of consumers who would not be able to afford,
   or who would not have a willingness to pay for, what would otherwise be
   less expensive access. For example, Google is planning to offer
   broadband access to end-users for free in San Francisco by charging
   other content providers for advertising. This product offering is
   evidently predicated on the belief that many end-users demand discounted
   or free broadband access that is paid for by parties other than
   themselves. Proponents of network neutrality regulation argue that such
   restrictions on the pricing policies of network operators are necessary
   to preserve innovation on the edges of the network, as opposed to
   innovation within the network. However, recognizing that network
   congestion and real-time applications demand some differential pricing
   according to bandwidth or priority, proponents of network neutrality
   regulation would allow broadband Internet access providers to charge
   higher prices to end-users (but not content or applications providers)
   who consume more bandwidth or who seek priority delivery of certain
   traffic. Thus, the debate over network neutrality is essentially a
   debate over how best to finance the construction and maintenance of a
   broadband network in a two-sided market in which senders and receivers
   have additive demand for the delivery of a given piece of
   information-and hence additive willingness to pay. Well-established
   tools of Ramsey pricing from regulatory economics can shed light on
   whether network congestion and recovery of sunk investment in
   infrastructure are best addressed by charging providers of content and
   applications, broadband users, or both for expedited delivery.
   Apart from this pricing problem, an analytically simpler component of
   proposed network neutrality regulaion would prohibit a network operator
   from denying its users access to certain websites and Internet
   applications, such as voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). Although some
   instances of blocking of VoIP have been reported, such conduct is not a
   serious risk to competition. To address this concern, I analyze whether
   market forces (that is, competition among access providers) and existing
   regulatory structures are sufficient to protect broadband users. I
   conclude that economic welfare would be maximized by allowing access
   providers to differentiate services vis-a-vis providers of content and
   applications in value-enhancing ways and by relying on existing legal
   regimes to protect consumers against the exercise of market power,
   should it exist.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines the coordination of inputs to the development and
   use of technology as a problem in the theory of property. Recent
   misunderstanding of property, in terms of both the substance of its
   rights and the implications of its remedies, have presented property as
   an obstacle tourather than as a platform forurapidly evolving
   technology. This article will first present a framework for property
   that captures its role in organizations, intellectual property, as well
   as property law itself. An information-cost theory of property stresses
   modularity, standardization, and hybrid systems of private and common
   rights, which allow for separation of functions and specialization.
   Modularity and separation in property allow for specialization but also
   give rise to the potential for strategic behavior. Each specialist may
   only maximize locally, which can lead to social losses. To counteract
   this strategic behavior, a combination of boundary placement and
   interface rules can be used, as is commonly seen in common property
   systems and their variants. The article then applies this framework to
   Standard-Setting Organizations (SSOs) and shows that separation of the
   standardization function is yet another type of property separation and
   specialization. As with other dimensions of separation, strategic
   behavior becomes possible. But contrary to some widespread views, the
   tools of property do not simply cause the problem of opportunistic
   holdup in SSOs; property also provides some solutions, in this case
   through doctrines of equity that are aimed at counteracting opportunism
   in general.}},

   authorized agencies, existing during the consideration of cases of the
   antitrust violations by using of specialized software. The task of legal
   regulation in contemporary conditions is to determine instruments, which
   could be used for prevention and constraint of the using of digital
   intelligence to the detriment of participants of economic affairs, by
   stimulating of the using of the technologies for the benefit of the
   competition. The special attention is focused on the issue of liability
   for these violations. Authors defined the preventive measures, which
   could provide the compliance of antitrust legislation during the
   development and using of price algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Search firms provide matchmaking services between consumers and
   suppliers that are central to the efficiency of the economy. The
   significant economic contributions of search firms as commercial
   intermediaries have important implications for antitrust policy towards
   search markets. As search firms generate more information about buyers
   and sellers, they become intermediaries for an increasing proportion of
   economic transactions. This article introduces the concept of the ``map
   of commerce{''} to describe the extensive directory of business
   constructed by search firms. This article also introduces the concept of
   the ``circular flow of information{''} to represent the comprehensive
   nature of the economic information managed by search firms. These firms
   induce information revelation through self-selection both by consumers
   and by advertisers. Consumers reveal personal information through the
   use of keywords and through their online behavior. Advertisers reveal
   company information by bidding on positions on the search page. Search
   firms employ information to match buyers with sellers more effectively
   and to increase earnings from advertising. The analysis shows that
   economic efficiencies generated by the circular flow of information
   depend on the strength of competition among search firms. The discussion
   considers antitrust policy towards Internet search markets, including
   issues of privacy, competition, and cooperative agreements.}},

Abstract = {{One hot topic is whether Google has violated the antitrust laws. Another
   important topic is how behavioral economics can enrich antitrust policy.
   This article examines two implications of behavioral economics on
   antitrust monopolization law.The article first discusses trial-and-error
   learning as an entry barrier. This is timely given the current debate
   over the entry barriers of the search engine market. The article next
   discusses behavioral exploitation to maintain a monopoly. The behavioral
   economics literature can help explain the European Commissions tying
   claims against Microsoft, why the Commissions original remedy failed,
   and the benefits and risks of the Commissions remedy involving its
   subsequent prosecution of Microsoft over Internet browsers.}},

Abstract = {{It is conventional wisdom that transparency in cartels-monitoring of
   competitors' prices, sales, and profits-facilitates collusion. However,
   in several recent cases cartels have instead worked to preserve the
   privacy of their participants' actions and outcomes. Toward explaining
   this behavior, we show that cartels can sometimes sustain higher profits
   when actions and outcomes are observed only privately, because better
   information can hinder collusion by helping firms devise more profitable
   deviations from the collusive agreement. We provide conditions under
   which maintaining privacy is optimal for cartels that follow a
   market-segmentation strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Shifts in global trade, technological developments and the COVID-19
   pandemic all provide an opportunity for Southeast Asia to grow its
   digital economy and accelerate economic recovery. Market dynamics are
   changing, with the rise of online platforms catering to the growing base
   of digitally literate consumers. Such platforms offer a wide choice of
   products and services at greater convenience, across borders and through
   different participants in the supply chain. Existing markets are
   becoming more competitive and new markets are being created as
   businesses benefit from digital technologies and draw insights from
   large volumes of available data. However, as the digital economy
   expands, sophisticated forms of anti-competitive behaviour are also
   emerging. Around the world, there are concerns that online platforms are
   becoming dominant and engaging in harmful conduct, such as collecting
   and using customer data-without consent-to exclude current and future
   competitors. Southeast Asia is vulnerable to these concerns, too. Using
   case studies, this study highlights why such concerns, if left
   unaddressed, pose a threat to competition in the ``new{''} ASEAN
   economy.}},

Abstract = {{Oliver Williamson's contributions to many subfields of economics are
   salutary. However, he was recognized by the Nobel Laureate Committee
   primarily for his work on the boundaries (scale and scope) of the firm.
   This tribute endeavors to marry Williamson's transaction cost economics
   with a capabilities framework to obtain new insights into how the scope
   and scale of technology companies influence their competitive
   performance in today's digital economy. The role of big data and
   learning are highlighted. Strong implications for competition policy,
   and for management, emerge from the fusion of the two frameworks. Such
   fusion yields a more granular view of management and policy issues but
   requires the policy analyst to understand not just industrial economics
   but also the technology management literature which also has useful
   insights for competition policy and regulatory professionals.}},

Abstract = {{Modern mobile commerce enterprises of any format and dimension, due to
   their flexibility and technological efficiency, are able to adapt to the
   changing environmental conditions and form new areas of activity in
   accordance with the challenges of the time. Mobile commerce is a
   continuation of e-commerce, the transfer of e-commerce into the most
   diverse mobile forms. Forms of the implementation of mobile commerce and
   its innovative mobile communication technologies allow you to transfer
   the information flow to the most advanced mobile gadgets of users,
   giving them complete freedom in their movements in space. The article
   discusses the objects of mobile commerce, provides a classification and
   analysis of market activities of subjects of mobile commerce. National
   peculiarities of entrepreneurship in the mobile commerce market of
   Russia are revealed. The quartet of the largest federal players in a
   completely mature mobile commerce market created a unique situation of
   the classical oligopoly in the face of imperfect competition, which put
   the domestic antitrust authority in a difficult position. Although the
   appearance of reliable competition requires a reduction in the financial
   success of each member of this strategic group, a kind of quadriga, in
   particular a decrease in marginal service revenue, a decrease in the
   growth rate of net profit, the reality of cartel conspiracy, especially
   in terms of price and tariff formation for a range of services mobile
   communications, of harmonization of nonprice instruments, more and more
   becomes convex and tangible. And the extremely high indicators and
   characteristics of market concentration and tension for the oligopoly
   structure of mobile operators can become the source material of the case
   study for analysts of the territorial administrations of the FAS RF.
   While working on a report for the IBIMA Conference, the authors pay
   special attention to the construction and testing of a statistical model
   for analyzing the revenue from advertising activity of oligopolistic
   quartet participants in the mobile communications market.}},

Abstract = {{In selection markets, where the cost of serving consumers is
   heterogeneous and noncontractible, nonprice product features allow a
   firm to sort profitable from unprofitable consumers. An example of this
   ``sorting by quality'' is the use of down payments to dissuade borrowers
   who are unlikely to repay. We study a model in which consumers have
   multidimensional types and a firm offers a single product of endogenous
   quality, as in Spence (1975). These two ingredients generate a novel
   sorting incentive in a firm's first-order condition for quality, which
   is a simple ratio. The denominator is marginal consumer surplus, a
   measure of market power. The numerator is the covariance, among marginal
   consumers, between marginal willingness to pay for quality and cost to
   the firm. We provide conditions under which this term is signed and
   contrast the sorting incentives of a profit-maximizer and a social
   planner. We then use this characterization to quantify the importance of
   sorting empirically in subprime auto lending, analytically sign its
   impact in a model of add-on pricing, and calibrate optimal competition
   policy in health insurance markets.}},

Abstract = {{We point to deficits in current global institutional arrangements in
   support of agricultural development and food and nutrition security. A
   framework for global institutional arrangements proposed here is the set
   of essential international public goods for a well-functioning world
   food system. These public goods include international natural resource
   management; trade and transboundary competition policy; research and
   innovation; handling large scale food emergencies; and transboundary
   food safety. Based on the framework, and institutional economics
   considerations, causes of current malfunctioning of global food
   governance are analyzed. It is proposed to redesign global food
   governance by establishing an international platform with policy
   clusters mapped along the set of global public goods. To support the
   platform with needed research-based evidence an International Panelon
   Food, Nutrition and Agriculture (IPFNA) is suggested, partly following
   the design of the Intergovernmental Panelon Climate Change (IPCC).
   Existing organizations and mechanisms would form building blocks of the
   strengthened and redesigned governance system. A gradual approach toward
   redesign is proposed. Some redesign in the suggested direction was
   triggered by the food crisis of 2008, as demonstrated by the reform of
   the Committee on Food Security (CFS) with its high level panel of
   experts, but more is needed.}},

Abstract = {{As antitrust becomes more complex, so do its remedies. While access and
   disclosure remedies have been a part of antitrust law since the very
   earliest days of the Sherman Act, they have become a vital part of
   litigated cases and settlements only recently in both the United States
   and the European Union. This has been particularly true for cases
   involving network industries, telecommunications, broadcasting, software
   platforms, and other high-technology industries at the forefront of
   antitrust enforcement. Interestingly, these cases and settlements
   constitute an informal revival of the essential facilities doctrine and
   an acknowledgement that the doctrine (and its equivalents) remain an
   important and needed part of the antitrust toolkit. This article will
   examine the growing use of complex behavioral remedies in both merger
   and monopolization cases, which suggest antitrust enforcement has moved
   far beyond any stated preference for structural remedies. Among the
   examples I use are the Microsoft and Intel litigation in the United
   States and the European Union, as well as more recent merger consent
   decrees involving Google-ITA, Comcast-Universal, and
   Livenation-Ticketmaster to illustrate these important changes in
   competition law enforcement and what they portend for the future.}},

Abstract = {{The price parity clauses (PPCs) that online booking platforms impose
   have come under antitrust scrutiny. Wang and Wright (2017) show how by
   preventing showrooming, a narrow PPC can reduce search costs and benefit
   consumers under between-platform competition. In response to having to
   give up its wide PPC to hotels, Booking.com emphasized its best price
   guarantee (BPG) to customers. We observe that a narrow PPC combined with
   a (low hassle costs) BPG leaves only Wang and Wright's Price Parity and
   Monopoly Equilibrium (PPME), in which consumers are worse off than with
   no platform operating at all. A more-efficient (incumbent) platform can
   deter entry with the BPG, while the narrow PPC eliminates competition
   from direct sales channels. An equally-efficient platform could enter
   and compete consumer prices down because of the existence of hassle
   costs, yet this equilibrium is fragile to network effects. If sellers
   have incentives not to price differentiate between platform(s) and their
   direct sales channel, a narrow PPC alone suffices to sustain the PPME in
   both cases. The detrimental pricing contract combination that we point
   out calls for different platform competition policy. (c) 2018 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Search engines face an interesting tradeoff in choosing the way to
   display their results. While providing high quality unpaid, or ``left
   side{''} results attracts users, doing so can also cannibalize the
   revenue that comes from paid ads on the ``right side{''}. This paper
   examines this tradeoff, focusing, in particular, on the role of users'
   post-search interaction with the websites whose links are displayed. In
   the model, high quality left side results boost demand from users,
   causing them to tolerate a search engine on which advertisers do not
   offer the lowest possible prices for the goods that they sell. However,
   because websites appearing on the left side still have an incentive to
   compete in the same market as advertisers, an increase in quality on the
   left side may reduce advertisers equilibrium prices. I analyze the
   circumstances under which this will occur and discuss the model's
   potential implications for antitrust policy. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Multisided platforms have distinct and critical features that set them
   apart from single-sided markets. This realization has led to a split
   among courts, antitrust practitioners, and economists as to the best
   method to assess whether mergers or conduct that involve platforms
   result in the creation or maintenance of monopoly power and violate the
   antitrust laws. Some argue that each side of a platform constitutes a
   separate relevant product market. Others argue for a single, integrated
   market that incorporates all sides. We argue that any prima facie
   antitrust assessment of competitive harm must incorporate the impact to
   consumers on all sides regardless of market definition. We also explain
   why output effects should be the primary emphasis of competitive effects
   analyses. The Supreme Court recently and correctly adopted this approach

Abstract = {{Google Search and its algorithm have been subject to intense antitrust
   scrutiny from competition authorities both in the United States and
   around the world. Google's introduction of Universal Search in 2007
   integrated specialized search results within a narrow category (for
   example, shopping or local businesses) with its customary ``blue
   links.{''} This integration led to objections that Google was engaging
   in ``search bias,{''} and thus foreclosing specialized search rivals to
   the detriment of competition and consumers. In this paper, we describe
   the precise nature of the anticompetitive claims against Google and
   develop an economic framework and empirical test to assess these claims.
   We rely upon our economic framework to offer insights for competition
   authorities to consider for future cases involving platforms and
   allegations of foreclosure and exclusion.}},

Abstract = {{A significant increase in regulatory activities throughout the world
   requires the development of a harmonized legal framework with the aim of
   protecting consumer rights, increasing the transparency of
   entrepreneurs, maintaining healthy competition, and protecting
   confidential information. The paper presents the author's view on the
   model of legal regulation of digital platforms in Russia. The five
   structural elements of the system of Russian legislation that are to be
   fixed in the rules of law are indicated. The authors have developed
   three theories of the features of the functioning of digital platforms,
   i.e. the theory of control and data management, the theory of the
   gratuitousness of the services of digital platforms, and the theory of
   competition of digital platforms, which should be put into the antitrust
   doctrine. It is confirmed that some countries have begun lawmaking
   activities to improve legislation but only in some areas. The conclusion
   is drawn on the formation of a single concept of legal regulation of
   digital platforms in Russia.}},

Abstract = {{The forming features of markets with network effects including the
   software markets are essentially important for effective business models
   in various spheres of business activity. First of all, it is connected
   with understanding of network effect and reasons of its use which are
   key factors not only commercial success of products and services, but
   also forming of adequate measures of economic policy, including
   antitrust.
   The article describes the case against Google, Inc. and Google Ireland
   Limited company (affiliated company) on suspicion of violation of the
   Russian antitrust law. The market of the pre-installed applications for
   OC Android localized for Russia which represents the market with network
   effects is a subject of the economic analysis. The signs of antitrust
   violation include the characteristics of the multilateral markets, in
   particular a platform (app store of Google) on the sides of market
   without which very difficult to create and support directly the product
   at the market. Namely bundling or tying which can be considered as
   equivalent of excluding agreement to create barriers on the market for
   the potential newcomer.
   The description of similar cases like the case against Google, Inc.
   corporation and the Google Ireland Limited company, and also the case
   against the Microsoft company which showed all difficulties of law
   application in the field of monopolization constraint (in terms of USA
   antitrust law) or abuse of dominance (in terms of European antitrust
   legislation) have the opportunity to show the fact that such decisions
   can be justified in principle.}},

Abstract = {{The widespread use of algorithmic technologies makes rules on tacit
   collusion, which are already controversial in antitrust law, more
   complicated. These rules have obvious limitations in effectively
   regulating algorithmic collusion. Although some scholars and
   practitioners within antitrust circles in the United States, Europe and
   beyond have taken notice of this problem, they have failed to a large
   extent to make clear its specific manifestations, root causes, and
   effective legal solutions. In this article, the authors make a strong
   argument that it is no longer appropriate to regard algorithms as mere
   tools of firms, and that the distinct features of machine learning
   algorithms as super-tools and as legal persons may inevitably bring
   about two new cracks in antitrust law. This article clarifies the root
   causes why these rules are inapplicable to a large extent to algorithmic
   collusion particularly in the case of machine learning algorithms,
   classifies the new legal cracks, and provides sound legal criteria for
   the courts and competition authorities to assess the legality of
   algorithmic collusion much more accurately. More importantly, this
   article proposes an efficacious solution to revive the market pricing
   mechanism for the purposes of resolving the two new cracks identified in
   antitrust law.}},
